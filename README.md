<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
- BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people. The company wants to know:
• Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
• How well those variables describe the bike demands
Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features, which can be accordingly manipulated for the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
## Conclusions
